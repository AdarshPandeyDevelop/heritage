Heritage Website – Interactive History Encyclopedia
Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Designed and developed a fully responsive, educational website that serves as a digital encyclopedia of historical knowledge. The project focuses on showcasing the rich cultural and historical heritage of various civilizations through engaging content, intuitive layout, and clean design.

The website includes well-structured sections covering monuments, historical rulers, and influential philosophers, each featuring text-based information alongside visually appealing design elements. JavaScript was used to add interactivity, such as collapsible content, smooth scrolling, and dynamic page transitions, enhancing the overall user experience.

Built with mobile-first principles, the layout adapts seamlessly across screen sizes—from desktops to tablets and smartphones. Extensive testing was done to ensure cross-browser compatibility, so the website performs consistently across major platforms like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
